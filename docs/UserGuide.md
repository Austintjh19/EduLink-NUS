### 3.3 How to use EduLink-NUS commands:
<a id="how-to-use-edulink-nus-commands"></a>

In EduLink-NUS, a parameter prefix acts as a delimiter for specifying different types of parameters in commands. Here's a reference table for common parameter prefixes and their corresponding parameters:

| Parameter Prefix | Corresponding Parameter |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| `id/`            | `STUDENT_ID`            |
| `n/`             | `NAME`                  |
| `p/`             | `PHONE_NUMBER`          |
| `e/`             | `EMAIL`                 |

#### 3.3.2 Parameters:
<a id="parameters"></a>

In EduLink-NUS, a parameter represents a placeholder where users input data. Parameters typically follow immediately after their corresponding Parameter Prefixes. Essentially they are to be supplied by the user.

Each parameter has unique constraints, which restrict what users can input for the parameter. Refer to the table below for details.

<box type="info" seamless>
Some parameters do not come along with their own Parameter Prefix. E.g. KEYWORD and INDEX.

| Parameter      | Parameter Prefix | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

<box type="info" seamless>
<b>Some Limitations: </b> </br>
- System date can be modified as to allow for `INTAKE` to be of any year after the current year.</br>
- Domain name of email can take in 2 consecutive special characters. E.g. test@exam..ple.com.

#### 3.3.3 Command Format:
<a id="command-format"></a>

To understand how a full command is interpreted, we will utilise the following example.

**Example:** `add n/NAME id/STUDENT_ID p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS in/INTAKE m/MAJOR [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹`

|             | Component Name    | Meaning                                                         |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`add`**   | Command           | Will result in the execution of the Add Command by EduLink-NUS. |
| **`n/`**    | Parameter Prefix  | Distinguishes `NAME` from other input fields.                   |
| **`NAME`**  | Parameter         | Represents placeholder for name of the student.                 |


You'll notice that `[TAG]` is wrapped in square brackets, indicating that it's an optional component.

- For example, in `n/STUDENT_NAME [t/TAG]`, you can include a tag like `t/TA` or simply input the student's name as `n/John`.

Moreover, notice that `[t/TAG]` is followed by an ellipsis (`â€¦`). This signifies that items followed by an ellipsis can be entered multiple times, including zero times.

- For example, `n/STUDENT_NAME [t/TAG]â€¦` can be used with no tags at all, like `n/John`, or with multiple tags, such as `n/John t/Math t/TA`.

**General Notes about EduLink-NUS:**<br>

* Duplicate student entires is defined as 2 person who have identical `STUDENT_ID`.

* All the previous History for `undo` will be cleared after you exit the Application i.e. You can't undo a Command if you exit EduLink-NUS and Start again.

* All Recent Commands will be cleared after you exit the Application i.e. You can't fetch recent commands if you exit EduLink-NUS and start again.


* Unless explicitly stated otherwise, when indicating character limitations, spaces between words are counted within the total character count, while any leading or trailing spaces are not included in the calculation.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands are case-insensitive. e.g `filter` and `Filter` are the same command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/TA` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/TA`, `t/TA t/Helpful` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `undo`, list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* The `INDEX` value must fall within the range of 1 to 2,147,483,647. Any value outside of this range will be deemed incorrect. Moreover, if the value falls within the specified range but is not found in the student list panel, it will be considered out of bounds.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**IMPORTANT !!!**<br>

* **TAB** key serve a distinct purpose and should now be utilised for creating four whitespaces.

* **UP** & **DOWN** arrow keys serve a distinct purpose within the application.

* Any parameter supplied by the user must not contain the **/** character as it serves a distinct purpose in the application.

## 5. FAQ
<a id="faq"></a>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduLink-NUS home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6 Known issues
<a id="known-issues"></a>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **`NAME` Parameter**, if you try to enter a name that contains `/` the application will show error message about invalid format for `NAME` but someone can have `/` in their legal name e.g `Prabhat S/O Radhe`, this limitation arises due to usage of `/` character for Internal use within the Application. The remedy is to use `|` i.e. pipe character in place of `/`. We Understand that this format doesn't comply with their Legal Names but Since Our Application identifies students based on their StudentID , this remedy doesn't limit the Capabilities of EduLink-NUS in any possible way.
