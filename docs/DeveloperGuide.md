## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<box type="info" seamless>
Please note that certain aspects, such as UML classes, may have been <b>simplified</b> to fit within the diagram's constraints and <b>maintain readability</b>.
</box>


### Add feature

This feature enables users to seamlessly integrate new student profiles into the EduLink-NUS application. To ensure data integrity and completeness, the system necessitates the inclusion of essential parameters such as Name, Student ID, Phone Number, Email, Address, Intake, and Major. Additionally, users have the option to include tags.
The activity diagram below shows the sequence of action users will have to take to add a new Student Profile into the EduLink-NUS application.

<puml src="diagrams/add/AddActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram - Add"/>

#### Implementation - Class Diagram:

The below class diagram represents the key classes and their relationships involved in the implementation of the Add feature in the EduLink-NUS application.

<puml src="diagrams/add/AddClassDiagram.puml" alt="Class Diagram - Add"/>

Some additional information:
* ParserUtil Class: Helper classes used by the AddCommandParser for parsing and validation tasks.
  * E.g. Automatic removal of additional whitespaces in user inputs. E.g. `John        Doe ` will be parsed as `John Doe`.
* ArgumentMultimap Class: ArgumentMultimap helps in mapping command arguments, while ParserUtil provides utility methods for parsing different types of data.
* AddCommand Class: Represents the command to add a new student to the application. Upon execution, it produces a CommandResult. It initializes and adds instances of the Student class.

#### Implementation - Design Considerations:

Automatic Removal of Additional Whitespaces reasoning:
Storing extra whitespaces doesn't add any meaningful information and only introduces unnecessary complexity. By automatically removing these additional whitespaces, the system ensures that data is stored in a clean and consistent format, without sacrificing any essential information.

Creating a new ParserUtil for Data Validation:
* Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):
    * Description: he current implementation separates data validation into a dedicated ParserUtil class, providing a centralized location for validation functions.
    * Pros: Promotes code modularity and maintainability by isolating validation logic from other components, facilitating easier updates and modifications.
    * Cons: Introduces an additional layer of abstraction, potentially increasing complexity.
* Alternative 2:
  * Description: Incorporate validation functions directly within each relevant class, such as Student, Name, Email, etc., eliminating the need for a separate ParserUtil class.
  * Pros: Provides more context-specific validation, allowing each class to enforce its own constraints and behaviors tailored to its purpose.
  * Cons May result in code duplication if similar validation logic is required across multiple classes, leading to potential maintenance challenges.

  We chose Alternative 1 for its centralized validation logic in ParserUtil, promoting code modularity, consistency, and easier maintenance. This approach ensures uniformity across validation rules and We chose Alternative 1 due to the nature of our parameters; name, address, and major share similar validation requirements.
Centralized validation in ParserUtil ensures uniformity, simplifying maintenance and testing across classes, promoting code modularity, and enhancing consistency.


### Find feature

This find feature enables the search for students in the EduLink-NUS application based on their Names, Student IDs, or Both.
The search specification will vary depending on the search parameter. i.e. using Names, Student IDs, or Both. Below is a brief summary:
* Searching by Name - Single Word:
  * Partial word matching is supported when searching by a single word, but matches must commence from the first letter.
* Searching by Name - Multiple Words:
  * Only Student Names which contains the same chronological combination and ordering of those search words will be returned.
  * Specific location of the match is disregarded.
  Only the last search word will allow for partial word matching, but matches must commence from the first letter.
* Searching by ID:
  * Partial word matching is supported and matches need not commence from the first letter.
* Searching by both ID & Name:
  * Only entries with IDs and names that match both criteria will be returned.
  * The constraints for matches, both for Name and ID, are applied the same as when searching by Name and ID individually.

#### Implementation - Class Diagram:

Below is a representative class diagram of the feature. The implementation of this feature involved the creation of three new classes, those being IdAndNameContainsQueryIdAndNamePredicate, IdContainsQueryIdPredicate, and NameContainsQueryNamePredicate.
Each class is designed to address specific aspects of the search specifications outlined in the description. Essentially, they serve to encapsulate and modularize the logic for finding students based on different search criteria.

<puml src="diagrams/find/FindClassDiagram.puml" alt="UML Class Diagram - Find"/>

#### Implementation - Sequence Diagrams:

In the sequence diagram provided below, the interaction among various classes forming the foundation of the find feature is illustrated. The sequence is initiated when the user enters the command "find n/John D id/A123" into the command box, triggering the `execute("find n/John D id/A123")` method call in the LogicManager.

<puml src="diagrams/find/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UML Sequence Diagram - Find"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

The sequence diagram above reveals that the `FindCommand` constructor requires a `Predicate` argument. The determination of which specific predicate to pass — `IdAndNameContainsQueryIdAndNamePredicate`, `IdContainsQueryIdPredicate`, or `NameContainsQueryNamePredicate` — is elucidated below:

1. Parsing and Determination by FindCommandParser:
    - The `FindCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the command string and extracting relevant search criteria.
    - Based on the parsed criteria, such as name and ID prefixes in the command string, the `FindCommandParser` determines the appropriate predicate to use for the search.

2. Predicate Selection Criteria:
    - If the command includes both name and ID criteria (`n/John` and `id/A123`), the `FindCommandParser` selects `IdAndNameContainsQueryIdAndNamePredicate`.
    - If only the ID criterion is present (`id/A123`), the `FindCommandParser` selects `IdContainsQueryIdPredicate`.
    - If only the name criterion is present (`n/John`), the `FindCommandParser` selects `NameContainsQueryNamePredicate`.

3. Passing Predicate to FindCommand:
    - Once the appropriate predicate is determined, the `FindCommandParser` instantiates a `FindCommand` object, passing the selected predicate as an argument to its constructor.
    - This ensures that the `FindCommand` is equipped with the correct predicate for executing the search operation effectively.

The below sequence diagram highlights this process:

<puml src="diagrams/find/FindParserSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UML Sequence Diagram - Find Parser"/>

#### Implementation - Design Considerations:

Design of Predicate:
* Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):
  * Description: Each search criteria (e.g., ID, Name) has its own dedicated predicate class (e.g., IdContainsQueryIdPredicate, NameContainsQueryNamePredicate).
  * Pros: Encapsulates the logic for each search criterion in separate classes, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
  * Cons: Requires creating a significant number of predicate classes, potentially leading to codebase complexity.
* Alternative 2:
  * Description: Create a single, more generalized predicate class capable of handling multiple search criteria.
  * Pros:  Reduces the number of classes needed, simplifying the codebase.
  * Cons: Combining multiple search criteria into a single class may reduce modularity, making it harder to isolate and maintain specific functionality.

Design of Matching Name Criteria Reasoning:
* Partial word matching supported but must commence from fist letter:
  * Requiring matches to start from the first letter ensures that search results are precise and relevant. This prevents unrelated or unintended matches that might occur if partial matches were allowed to begin from any position within the name.
* Sequential Combination Matching: Requiring the names to contain the same chronological combination and ordering of the keywords ensures precise matches.

Design of Matching ID Criteria Reasoning:
* Partial matching for ID:
  * Allowing partial word matching for IDs enhances the flexibility of the search functionality. Users can search for IDs even if they don't remember the complete sequence, making it easier to find specific students.

### Export feature

This export feature enables the user to effectively export the students data into nicely formatted CSV file, which users can use to port the data to other Applications such as Excel, Spreadsheet
User just need to specify the `FileName` and successful execution will create the `FileName.csv` at `[JAR_FileLocation]/exports/Filename.csv`.

#### Implementation - Class Diagram:

Below is a representative class diagram of the feature. The implementation of this feature involved creation of one new class i.e CSVUtil , to handle the conversion between application data into CSV Format.

<puml src="diagrams/export/ExportClassDiagram.puml" alt="UML Class Diagram - Export"/>

#### Implementation - Sequence Diagrams:

<puml src="diagrams/export/ExportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UML Sequence Diagram - Export"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ExportCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

### Import feature

This import feature enables the user to import the students data into the application from a valid `JSON` file,
User just need to specify the `FileName` and successful execution will import the data from `FileName.json` located at `[JAR_FileLocation]/data/Filename.json`.

#### Implementation - Class Diagram:

Below is a representative class diagram of the feature. The implementation of this feature didn't involved creation of any class , but it requires some new dependencies to be introduced in order to follow OOP Design. i.e Including `Storage` Object in the `ImportCommand`.

<puml src="diagrams/import/ImportClassDiagram.puml" alt="UML Class Diagram - Import"/>

#### Implementation - Sequence Diagrams:

<puml src="diagrams/import/ImportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UML Sequence Diagram - Import"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ImportCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

### Grade Feature

The Grade feature allows users to efficiently manage and update student grades within the EduLink-NUS application. To maintain data integrity and completeness, the system requires the inclusion of essential parameters such as Student ID, Module Code and Score. The feature adds or edits depending on the existence of the grade for the specified module and student.
* if a grade record for the specified student and module already exists:
  * Updates existing record with the new score.
* if a grade record for the specified student and module does not exist:
  * Adds new grade record to the student's record.

The activity diagram below illustrates the sequence of actions users will undertake to add or update student grades within the EduLink-NUS application.

<puml src="diagrams/grade/GradeActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram - Grade"/>

#### Implementation - Class Diagrams:

Below is a representative class diagram of the feature. The implementation of this feature involved the creation of five new classes:
* Grade: represents grade record for a student within EduLink-NUS.
* Module, Score and LetterGrade: represents the essential information to stored in the grade record.
* GradeUtil: to handle the conversion from numerical Score to LetterGrade.

<puml src="diagrams/grade/GradeClassDiagram.puml" alt="UML Class Diagram - Grade"/>

#### Implementation - Sequence Diagrams:

In the sequence diagram provided below, the interaction among various classes forming the foundation of the grade feature is illustrated.

<puml src="diagrams/grade/GradeSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UML Sequence Diagram - Grade"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `GradeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

The sequence diagram reveals that the `GradeCommand` constructor requires `ID` and `Grade` arguments. The `Grade` argument contains a numerical value representing the grade. This numerical grade is to be processed by the `GradeUtil` class to generate the corresponding letter grade using predefined predicates.

Additional Information:
- **ParserUtil Class**: This class serves as a helper for the GradeCommandParser, facilitating parsing and validation tasks related to grade data inputs.
- **ArgumentMultimap Class**: ArgumentMultimap aids in mapping command arguments for grade-related operations, while ParserUtil offers utility methods for parsing different types of grade data.
- **GradeCommand Class**: Represents the command to add or update a student's grade within the application. Upon execution, it generates a CommandResult. It initializes and manages instances of the Grade class.
- **GradeUtil Class**: This class serves as a helper for the Grade, generating letter grade based on predefined predicate for score range of each letter grade automatically.

#### Implementation - Design Considerations:

Design of Parsing Grade Data Input:
* **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
  - **Description**: Validation tasks are centralized within the ParserUtil class, offering a modular and maintainable approach.
  - **Pros**: Promotes code modularity and ease of maintenance by isolating validation logic from other components. Facilitates seamless updates and modifications.
  - **Cons**: Introduces an additional layer of abstraction, potentially increasing complexity.
* **Alternative 2**:
  - **Description**: Embed validation functions directly within relevant classes, such as Grade, Module and Score, eliminating the need for a separate ParserUtil class.
  - **Pros**: Provides context-specific validation, allowing each class to enforce its constraints and behaviors independently.
  - **Cons**: May lead to code duplication if similar validation logic is required across multiple classes, posing maintenance challenges.

Design of Parsing Letter Grade:
* **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
  - **Description**: Score range for each letter range are set and centralized within the GradeUtil class using predicate, offering a modular and maintainable approach.
  - **Pros**: Promotes code modularity and ease of maintenance by isolating validation logic from other components. Facilitates seamless updates and modifications.
  - **Cons**: Introduces an additional layer of abstraction, potentially increasing complexity.
* **Alternative 2**:
  - **Description**: Having the user input the letter grade directly in the command without calculating it based on the numerical score.
  - **Pros**: Simplifies the input process for users, as they can directly specify the letter grade without needing to know the corresponding numerical score. Avoids the need for complex validation and conversion logic within the application.
  - **Cons**: Relies heavily on user input accuracy and understanding, potentially leading to input errors Not suitable if the application needs to perform calculations or analyses based on numerical scores rather than letter grades such as finding the Mean, Median, Maximum and Minimum.

Design of Editing Grade:
* **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
  - **Description**: The GradeCommand is responsible for both adding new grade records and editing existing ones.
  - **Pros**: Centralized logic within the GradeCommand class simplifies the codebase and reduces redundancy. Users interact with a single command for both adding and editing grades, not having to remember one more command word.
  - **Cons**: May lead to complexity within the GradeCommand class, especially as additional editing functionalities are introduced.
* **Alternative 2**:
  - **Description**: Create a new EditGradeCommand class dedicated to editing existing grade records.
  - **Pros**: Editing logic is isolated in its own command class, promoting code organization and maintainability. Each command class has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.
  - **Cons**: Requires additional command classes. Users may need to remember separate commands for adding and editing grades, which could impact usability.

### Tag Feature

The Tag feature allows users to add tags to a student's profile. The user needs to specify the student to tag by inputting the student's ID. Users can add several tags at once to improve working efficiency.
* If one or more tags the user want to add are already there, the system will display an error message to inform the user.
* If the ID/tag user inputs are invalid, the system will display the constraints for parameters.
* Tags are designed to be case-insensitive. If the user adds several equivalent tags at once, only one of them will be added to prevent duplication.

#### Implementation - Class Diagrams:

Below is a representative class diagram of the `tag` feature.

<puml src="diagrams/tag/TagClassDiagram.puml" alt="UML Class Diagram - Tag"/>

#### Implementation - Sequence Diagrams:

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction of different classes to execute add tag command.

<puml src="diagrams/tag/TagSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UML Sequence Diagram - Tag"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `TagCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.
</box>

#### Implementation - Design Considerations:

Design of Parsing Tag Input:
* **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
    - **Description**: Validation tasks are centralized within the ParserUtil class, offering a modular and maintainable approach.
    - **Pros**: Promotes code modularity and ease of maintenance by isolating validation logic from other components. Facilitates seamless updates and modifications.
    - **Cons**: Introduces an additional layer of abstraction, potentially increasing complexity.
* **Alternative 2**:
    - **Description**: Embed validation functions directly within TagCommandParser.
    - **Pros**: More straightforward and independent from the rest of the code.
    - **Cons**: Inconsistent with the rest code base, harder to maintain and reuse.


Design of Tag message:
* **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
    - **Description**: Tags names should be alphanumeric. Tags are restricted to 20 characters long.  Tags are case-insensitive: TA and ta are the same.
    - **Pros**: Make sure tags messages are brief, and work like tag. Standardize tags.
    - **Cons**: User loses some freedom to customize their tag.
* **Alternative 2**:
    - **Description**: User can input whatever they s/he wants as the tag message.
    - **Pros**: User has more freedom.
    - **Cons**: Harder to manage user input. Less bug-provoking.


### Undo feature

#### Implementation - Class Diagram:

Below is a representative class diagram of the feature. The implementation of this feature didn't involved creation of any class, but some additional fields in the preexisting classes and changes in methods.

<puml src="diagrams/undo/UndoClassDiagram.puml" alt="UML Class Diagram - Undo"/>

#### Implementation - Sequence Diagram:

<puml src="diagrams/undo/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UML Sequence Diagram - Undo"/>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


We decided to choose the Alternative 1 and limit the number of Past History Saved to 20 i.e. User can only revert back from last 20 commands only to avoid the Performance issue and keep the implementation Simple.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should be responsive to user input, as user might have a series of commands to execute.
5.  Should have a resizable UI as the user might work on different programs in parallel.
6.  Should be able to use Offline (without Internet Connection).
